Is there anything else you feel I should know about your background?

Why are you taking the class?
Out of sheer curiosity, I had taken an online offering on Heterogeneous Parallel Programming by Prof. Wen-Mei Hwu on Coursera. It basically introduced the basics of memory architecture used in parallel environments(CUDA C) and algorithms like tiled matrix, tiled convolution,etc. with dummy data. I loved learning about them and I think this class gives me one of the best opportunities to dive deeper into the field and explore some of the intrinsic performance considerations and optimizations in computer programs. I strongly believe that the skills I will learn at this class on reasoning about programs and fine tuning them would in turn make be not only a better computer programmer, but also a good problem-solver in general.
