Is there anything else you feel I should know about your background?
During my undergrad, out of sheer curiosity, I had taken an online offering on Heterogeneous Parallel Programming by Prof. Wen-Mei Hwu on Coursera. It basically introduced the basics of memory architecture used in parallel environments(CUDA C) and algorithms like tiled matrix, tiled convolution,etc. 

Why are you taking the class?
I think this class gives me one of the best opportunities to explore intrinsic performance considerations and optimizations in computer programs. I strongly believe that the skills I will learn at this class on reasoning about programs and fine tuning them would in turn make me not only a better computer programmer, but also a good problem-solver in general.
